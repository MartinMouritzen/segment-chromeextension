# segment-chromeextension

Chrome extension tracking Segment-like events, so you can easily see what's being sent to:
* [Segment](https://segment.com/)
* [Rudderstack](https://www.rudderstack.com/)
* [Dreamdata](https://dreamdata.io/) 
* [Attribution](https://attributionapp.com/)

Tracks all outgoing Segment-compatible API calls, and shows them in the extension.
